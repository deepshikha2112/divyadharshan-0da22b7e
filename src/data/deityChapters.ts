She breathed life into the figure and named him Ganesha. She instructed him to guard the entrance and allow no one to enter while she bathed.

Young Ganesha stood firm at his post, filled with devotion to his mother. He was innocent yet determined, knowing nothing of the world but his duty to protect.

This was the beginning of one of the most beloved deities in Hindu tradition - the remover of obstacles, the lord of beginnings, Sri Ganesha.`

Ganesha, following his mother's instructions, firmly refused. A fierce confrontation ensued between the mighty Lord Shiva and the steadfast young guardian.

Despite being just a child, Ganesha's determination was unwavering. He fought with all his might to fulfill his duty to his mother. The battle was intense, and the heavens themselves shook with its power.

In the heat of battle, Lord Shiva, in his divine fury, severed the boy's head. The moment this happened, Parvati emerged and was struck with unbearable grief.`

Lord Shiva placed the elephant head on Ganesha's body and breathed new life into him. The divine child awoke, now with the head of an elephant, radiating wisdom and grace.

Shiva blessed his son: "You shall be worshipped first before all other deities. You shall be the remover of obstacles and the lord of new beginnings." Thus, Lord Ganesha was reborn with divine blessings.`

Lord Ganesha carries a modak (sweet) in his hand, representing the sweetness of spiritual knowledge. His mouse vehicle teaches us that even the smallest creature can carry the mightiest of gods.

To this day, millions begin their prayers, journeys, and new ventures by invoking Ganesha. "Om Gam Ganapataye Namaha" - the mantra that removes all obstacles from our path.`

Vasudeva, following divine instructions, carried the newborn across the flooding Yamuna river. The serpent Shesha sheltered them from the rain. He exchanged Krishna with the newborn daughter of Nanda and Yashoda in Gokul.

Thus began Krishna's childhood in Vrindavan - a time of pure joy and divine play. Yashoda became his loving foster mother, and the cowherd village became his playground.

The Gopis of Vrindavan, upon hearing his flute, would leave everything behind. They would abandon their homes, their families, even their sense of self, drawn irresistibly to the divine melody.

The Raas Leela - Krishna's cosmic dance with the Gopis - represents the soul's longing for the Divine. Each Gopi felt Krishna was dancing with her alone, as the Lord multiplied himself to be with each devotee personally.

Krishna's flute represents the call of the Divine to the human soul. When we empty ourselves like the hollow bamboo, the Lord can play his divine music through us. The flute's melody is the sound of pure love calling us home.`

"You have the right to work, but not to the fruits of your actions," Krishna taught. "Perform your duty without attachment. Find refuge in wisdom. Those who act with devotion, offering all actions to Me, are free from the bonds of karma."

The Gita teaches karma yoga (selfless action), bhakti yoga (devotion), jnana yoga (knowledge), and raja yoga (meditation). It is the essence of all spiritual wisdom, applicable to every human being regardless of their path or station in life.`

Krishna's love knows no boundaries. He ate the humble rice flakes offered by Sudama with the same joy as the grandest feast. He washed the feet of guests at Yudhishthira's Rajasuya sacrifice, though he himself was the Supreme Lord.

"Whoever offers Me a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or water with devotion - that offering of love from a pure heart I accept," Krishna promises in the Gita.

This is the essence of Krishna consciousness - that the Lord is accessible to all, at all times. He responds to the pure call of the heart, regardless of caste, creed, or status. He is the supreme friend who never abandons those who take refuge in him.`

Leaping into the sky, young Hanuman flew towards the sun. Indra, the king of gods, struck him with his thunderbolt, causing him to fall. Vayu, angered by the attack on his son, withdrew all air from the universe.

To appease Vayu and save creation, the gods blessed Hanuman with numerous gifts - immortality, invincibility, and powers beyond measure. But they also placed a condition: Hanuman would forget his powers until reminded at the right time.

Thus grew the mighty Hanuman, humble and devoted, unaware of the cosmic strength that lay dormant within him, waiting to be awakened in service of Lord Rama.`

The moment Hanuman saw Rama, something stirred deep within his heart. Here was the purpose of his existence, the master he was born to serve. When Rama spoke, Hanuman was enchanted by the sweetness and wisdom of his words.

Revealing his true form, Hanuman bowed at Rama's feet and offered his eternal service. From that moment, he lived only for Rama - thinking of Rama, speaking of Rama, working only for Rama's mission. This complete surrender became the foundation of his legendary devotion.`

As Jambavan reminded Hanuman of his divine nature, the devotee began to grow. He expanded until he stood as tall as a mountain. With a mighty roar of "Jai Shri Ram!", he leaped into the sky.

The ocean creatures watched in awe as Hanuman soared through the clouds. Demons tried to stop him; magical beings tried to trap him. But nothing could halt the flight of pure devotion. Hanuman crossed the hundred yojanas of ocean and landed in Lanka, ready to find his mother Sita.`

Before Ravana's court, Hanuman delivered Rama's message boldly. Enraged, Ravana ordered Hanuman's tail to be set on fire as punishment for a monkey's insolence.

But as they wrapped his tail with cloth soaked in oil, Hanuman began to grow. More cloth was needed, then more. His tail extended through the streets of Lanka. When they finally lit the fire, Hanuman shrank, slipped from his bonds, and leaped across the golden city.

Building by building, palace by palace, Hanuman burned Lanka with his flaming tail. Yet, by Sita's blessing, Ravana's inner quarters remained untouched. Having accomplished his mission, Hanuman extinguished his tail in the ocean and flew back to Rama with news that would launch the great war.`

Over millennia, the river gradually went underground, becoming invisible to human eyes. Yet its waters continue to flow, joining the Ganga and Yamuna at the sacred Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj.

This physical transformation mirrors a spiritual truth. Just as the Saraswati flows unseen beneath the earth, true knowledge flows silently through the universe, available to those who dive deep within themselves.

The goddess Saraswati represents this hidden stream of wisdom. Through meditation, study, and devotion, we can tap into this eternal flow and receive the blessings of divine knowledge.`

भरत चौदह वर्ष से राम की पादुका रखकर शासन कर रहे थे। जब सुना कि राम आ रहे हैं, समस्त अयोध्या सज गई।

दीपमाला जलाई गई। यही दीपावली की शुरुआत थी। राम का राज्याभिषेक हुआ। राम राज्य की स्थापना हुई।

राम राज्य में कोई दुखी न था। न अकाल, न महामारी। धर्म चारों चरणों पर चलता था। प्रजा सुखी थी, संतुष्ट थी।

मंगल भवन अमंगल हारी। द्रवहु सु दसरथ अजिर बिहारी॥
राम सीता बिहारी जय बोलो हनुमान की।
जय हो प्रभु श्री राम की॥

जो सुमिरत सिधि होई, गननायक करिबर बदन।
करहु अनुग्रह सोई, बुद्धि रासि सुभ गुन सदन॥`
