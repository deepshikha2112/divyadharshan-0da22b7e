He was nursed by the divine mothers and trained by the greatest warriors. Even as a child, he displayed exceptional valor and wisdom. His father Shiva was pleased with his son's divine qualities. The peacock Paravani became his mount, symbolizing the conquest of ego (the serpent the peacock defeats)."

        content: "When the time came, the gods appointed young Murugan as the commander of the divine army. Armed with the Vel (divine spear) given by his mother Parvati, he led the devas against Tarakasura's forces. The battle was fierce. Murugan's six faces coordinated a perfect strategy, his twelve arms wielded divine weapons. He finally slew Tarakasura with his Vel, fulfilling the prophecy and freeing the world from the demon's tyranny. He became known as 'Devasenapati' - commander of the divine army."

Their parents set a competition: whoever circled the world first would win the fruit. Murugan mounted his peacock and flew around the universe. When he returned, he found Ganesha had already won - by simply circling their parents, saying they were his entire world. Murugan felt humiliated and retreated to Palani hill, where his mother pacified him with the wisdom that he was the fruit (Pazham Ni - 'you are the fruit')."

When Brahma could not explain the meaning of the sacred syllable 'Om', young Murugan understood its deepest secrets. Shiva himself asked his son to enlighten him. The child instructed the Supreme Being, earning the title 'Swaminatha' (lord of the lord). This event shows that wisdom knows no age, and truth flows where it will."

Devasena (Devayanai), the daughter of Indra, represents the devout soul that is given to God by tradition and family. Valli, a tribal princess, represents the soul that God actively seeks and wins through love. Murugan appeared to Valli in various disguises to win her heart. Together, his marriages show that divine union comes both through tradition and personal spiritual effort."

Each represents a different aspect of his worship and different events from his mythology. Pilgrimage to all six is considered highly meritorious. The kavadi processions during Thai Pusam, where devotees carry decorated arches as acts of devotion, are among the most spectacular religious events in Hinduism."
